# 🚨 DISPATCH: Your Lifeline in Emergencies 🚨

**DISPATCH** is a **revolutionary emergency response app** that bridges the critical gap between citizens in distress and the dedicated responders who can help—police, firefighters, ambulance, and even traffic enforcers (CITOM). In those vital moments when **every second counts**, DISPATCH empowers you to get the help you need—fast, secure, and reliable.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Emergencies in the Philippines can be chaotic—panic sets in, crowds form, and some bystanders even start filming instead of calling for help. **DISPATCH** cuts through this confusion by putting a **direct line to trusted emergency responders** right in your hand—powered by modern technology and verified, real-world authentication.

---

## 🌟 Vision

To create a **safer, more responsive community** where every citizen can access emergency services quickly, reliably, and securely—empowering them to protect themselves and others.

---

## 🎯 Mission

- 🚀 Simplify and **streamline emergency access** for every Filipino.
- 🔒 Enable **verified, authenticated calls** for real, trusted emergency communication.
- 🌍 Overcome connectivity and verification barriers to ensure **no call for help goes unanswered**.

## 🛠️ Features

### 📱 Citizen Side
- 📋 **User Registration**: Personal info, selfie (for face verification), and SIM card number—leveraging the SIM Card Registration Act to discourage prank calls.
- 📞 **Direct Emergency Calling**: One-tap access to police, fire, ambulance, or CITOM responders.
- 🧠 **Verification**: Before calls go through, users must verify identity via:
  - 🤳 Face recognition (using selfie)
  - 📲 SIM number verification (via telecom API, if feasible)
- 🌐 **Free Data Support**: Uses “free data” features (like Facebook Messenger) so users can still reach help even without load.
- 🚨 **Nearby Incident Alerts**: Optional alerts within 10km of your location—**be aware, stay prepared**.

### 🚓 Responder Side
- 🔔 **Emergency Alerts**: **NDRRMC-style loud alerts** within 10km of the incident to grab responders’ attention immediately.
- 📍 **Verified Caller Data**: See who’s calling (name, photo, phone number, location) to quickly assess and prioritize real emergencies.
- 🗺️ **Location-based Response**: Integrated **map with directions** for faster and more efficient deployment to the scene.
